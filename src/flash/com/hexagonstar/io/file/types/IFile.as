File type classes can be	 * used to load files of a specific type from disk or network and manage these in a	 * unified way.<br>	 * 	 * <p>File objects that implement <code>IFile</code> can be used with any of the	 * hexagonlib file loaders like the <code>BulkLoader</code> or the	 * <code>ZipLoader</code>. They store information about the physical file as well as	 * it's content data after it has been loaded.</p><br>	 * 	 * <p>Every file type class provides a content property that returns the file's	 * content typed in an object type specific to the file type class, for example the	 * <code>BinaryFile</code>'s <code>contentAsBytes</code> property returns a	 * <code>ByteArray</code> while the <code>TextFile</code>'s	 * <code>contentAsString</code> property returns a <code>String</code>.</p> <p>To	 * provide a common content property, every file type class also allows to access the	 * file's content data with an untyped proptery named <code>content</code> which	 * simply delegates the class' specific content property. For example The content	 * property of the <code>BinaryFile</code> would still return a <code>ByteArray</code>	 * and the <code>TextFile</code>'s content property would still return a	 * <code>String</code>, only with the difference that the property's return type is	 * untyped.</p> <p>Additionally most file type classes also implement the	 * <code>contentAsBytes</code> property so their content can be obtained as a	 * <code>ByteArray</code> regardless of their default type.</p><br>	 * 	 * <p>After loading a file you can use the <code>valid</code> and <code>status</code>	 * properties to check if the file has been loaded and it's data has been parsed	 * successfully. Note that the <code>valid</code> property returns <code>false</code>	 * as long as no data has been loaded. The <code>status</code> property returns the	 * error text in case the file could not be loaded or parsed.</p>	 * 	 * @see com.hexagonstar.io.file.types.BinaryFile	 * @see com.hexagonstar.io.file.types.ImageFile	 * @see com.hexagonstar.io.file.types.SoundFile	 * @see com.hexagonstar.io.file.types.SWFFile	 * @see com.hexagonstar.io.file.types.TextFile	 * @see com.hexagonstar.io.file.types.XMLFile	 * @see com.hexagonstar.io.file.types.ZipFile	 */	public interface IFile extends IEventDispatcher	{		//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------		// Public Methods		//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------				/**		 * Returns a string representation of the file.		 * 		 * @return A string representation of the file.		 */		function toString():String;						//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------		// Getters & Setters		//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------				/**		 * The path of the file.		 */		function get path():String;		function set path(v:String):void;				/**		 * The ID of the file.
